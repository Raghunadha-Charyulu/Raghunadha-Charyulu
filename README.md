## Projects I Worked On

### Aluminum Surface Defect Detection using YOLOv8 and Swin Transformer
Built a deep learning pipeline to detect and classify surface defects on aluminum materials. Achieved 90% accuracy in classification using a hybrid of object detection and vision transformers. Improved quality control efficiency by 40% through data augmentation and interpretability techniques.

### Online Auction Platform (MERN Stack)
Built a full-stack auction system enabling real-time bidding and secure transactions using ReactJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB. Designed intuitive UIs for seller listings, bidder engagement, and integrated RESTful APIs for backend communication

### Fine-Tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using GPT-2
Fine-tuned the GPT-2 model on domain-specific datasets for advanced text generation tasks. Enhanced coherence and relevance of outputs using controlled decoding and token optimization. Demonstrated improved language understanding and contextual fluency in the generated text.

### MCQ Generator and Student Performance Metrics using SBERT and Gemini API
Designed an AI system that generates contextual MCQs from user input using sentence embeddings. Integrated a real-time user interface for assessments, feedback, and performance visualization. Enabled dynamic evaluation and tracking for aptitude and paragraph-based questions.
